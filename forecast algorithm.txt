Model Selection and Architecture

1. Model Selection
Algorithm: ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
Model Type: Time Series Forecasting (Captures trends, seasonality, and residual patterns)

2. Model Components
a) Trend Component:AR (Auto-Regressive) Component: Captures the dependence between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
I (Integrated) Component: Captures the trend in the series by differencing.
MA (Moving Average) Component: Captures the relationship between an observation and residual errors from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
b) Seasonality and Differencing:Configurable differencing to achieve stationarity if needed.
Option to use seasonal differencing for monthly, weekly, or custom seasonal patterns.

3. Model Parameters
p (Auto-Regressive Order): Number of lag observations included in the model
d (Differencing Order): Number of times the raw observations are differenced
q (Moving Average Order): Size of the moving average window
Seasonal Parameters (if seasonal ARIMA): (P, D, Q, m), where m is the season length
Optimization Technique: Maximum likelihood estimation for parameter tuning

4. Data Preprocessing Steps
Date Parsing and Formatting
Missing Value Imputation
Outlier Detection and Handling
Feature Engineering:
Day of week
Month
Is weekend
Peak/Off-peak indicators

5. Model Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
AIC/BIC (Akaike/Bayesian Information Criterion) for model selection

6. Forecast Output
Point Forecasts: Based on historical trends and seasonality
Confidence Intervals: Prediction intervals for each forecasted value
Daily Granularity: Forecast for each day
7-day Forecast Horizon for short-term predictions

7. Model Limitations and Assumptions
Stationarity Assumption: Assumes stationarity in time series data; differencing applied as needed
Limited to Historical Patterns: May not capture abrupt changes or unobserved external factors
Sufficient Historical Data Required: Model accuracy depends on quality and length of historical data
Assumes Regular Seasonality Patterns

8. Implementation Notes
Python Implementation: Using statsmodels or pmdarima for ARIMA model
Parameter Selection: Automated model selection using AIC/BIC or manual selection of (p, d, q)
Separate Models for Each Service Type: Each service type analyzed independently
Forecasts with Confidence Intervals: Includes prediction intervals
